/**
 * This interface represents a request abstraction. A response will be delivered eventually in the
 * future to any attached response listeners. The caller can attach three types of listeners:
 * <p>
 * A {@link SuccessListener} will receive any successfully produced data. The caller is responsible
 * to provide a correctly typed listener.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ErrorListener} will receive any errors the request mechanism can't recover from. The
 * error is delivered (not thrown) as {@code Throwable} callback argument.
 * <p>
 * A {@link FinishListener} will act as an event channel that will simply signal that the request
 * has finished. No information is provided through this callback, not even the state of the
 * response. This channel can be used to perform any state reset operations, like hiding progress
 * bars, etc, which aren't dependant on the success or failure state of a request.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of result object that is expected from the request. Any attached {@code
 *            SuccessListeners} must have the same type of generic definition.
